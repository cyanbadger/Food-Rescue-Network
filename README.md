⦁	Ideation :
The ideation behind the Food Rescue Network is to connect restaurants with surplus food to NGOs and volunteers who can distribute it. The core problem it addresses is food waste and hunger. The platform serves as a bridge, allowing restaurants to easily post their excess food and enabling others to claim it. The use of a simple Streamlit interface allows for a straightforward user experience with a posting form and a table of available food. The "Claim" button functionality ensures that the availability of food is updated in real-time. The backend, built with Python, stores these posts in a simple CSV or SQLite file. Future additions to the prototype include the ability to filter food posts by location or expiry time.

⦁	Tech Stack:
	Frontend: Streamlit was used to build the simple posting form and display the table.
	Backend: Python handles the logic and data storage.
	Database: Food posts are stored in either a CSV file or SQLite database.
	Add-on: A future feature would allow filtering posts by location or expiry time.
